+   .BeEF and Armitage integration.   +
+-------------------------------------+

The purpose of this script is to automate the sending of some  commands of BeEF 
and allow to control the zombies directly through the intuitive armitage's interface.
The ultimate goal would be to work on armitage as if you was in  the web panel of beef
and perform zombies's recruitment through armitage interface.

For use this script you need to download and install 
BeEF Metasploit Plugin from Christian Frichot github repository.
